### Hi, I‚Äôm Joel üëã

I work on Ruby conventions at **[Shopify](https://shopify.com)** from my home in Oxfordshire, UK. I maintian a few open source Ruby gems including **[Literal Enums](https://github.com/joeldrapper/literal_enums)**, **[Action State](https://github.com/joeldrapper/action_state)** and **[Ecase](https://github.com/joeldrapper/ecase)**. I‚Äôm currently developing a block-based view component system for Ruby / Rails called **[Phlex](https://github.com/joeldrapper/phlex)** and a ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù library of Tailwind Phlex components.

I write an newsletter called **[The Abstraction](https://www.theabstraction.space)** and co-host a weekly pair-pramming show, **[Naming Things](https://www.namingthings.org)**.
