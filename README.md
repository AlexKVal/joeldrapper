### Hi, Iâ€™m Joel ðŸ‘‹

I work on Ruby conventions at **[Shopify](https://shopify.com)** from my home in Oxfordshire, UK. I maintian a few open source Ruby gems including **[Literal Enums](https://github.com/joeldrapper/literal_enums)**, **[Action State](https://github.com/joeldrapper/action_state)** and **[Ecase](https://github.com/joeldrapper/ecase)**. Iâ€™m currently developing a block-based view component system for Ruby called **[Phlex](https://github.com/joeldrapper/phlex)** and a library of Tailwind Phlex components.
